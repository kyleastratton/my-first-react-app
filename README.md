# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Please make sure that you are using the LTS version of Node, otherwise errors may occur. Fire up a terminal instance, cd over to the folder containing your projects, and enter the following command:

`npm create vite@latest my-first-react-app -- --template react`
If you see the following output, enter `y` and then press `enter`:

Need to install the following packages:
`create-vite@4.X.X`
`Ok to proceed? (y)`

Once the command had begun executing, it should output the next steps for you to follow:
